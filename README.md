# SAM2017_G4

The client has proposed a workshop named “Software Architecture Mining” for an International Software Engineering Conference
to be held in February 2017. You are required to develop a web-based paper submission and review system for the workshop. 
The system will be referred to as “SAM2017” here after. 

SAM2017 should allow authors to submit their research papers. Submitter/Author(s) must first register before submitting the paper. 
Each time a paper is submitted, SAM2017 notifies the Program Committee Chair (PCC) and 
the submitter/author(s) about the submission. Upon completion of the paper submission deadline, the PCC notifies all the PCMs 
about availability of papers for review. In cases where the Submitter/Author is also a PCM, SAM2017 should make sure that 
the PCM should not be provided with a choice to review their own paper submissions.  The PCMs choose the papers that they 
want to review. Based on the choices, the PCC finds and assigns three PCMs for each paper. A PCM uses a template 
provided by SAM2017 to review and rate the paper. The reviews should ideally be submitted before the review submission deadline. 
Once all the reviews for the paper are entered the PCC is informed and the PCC rates the paper based on the reviews received. 
The PCC can also decide that the reviews present conflicting views and have the PCMs read each other’s review, 
discuss their viewpoints, and modify their reviews. The PCC then looks over the final reviews and rates the paper.
